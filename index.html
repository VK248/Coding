<h1>The Gateway Of India</h1>
<img id="TGOI"
     src="https://mediaindia.eu/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/sarang-pande-k3SHcT9zGkE-unsplash.jpg"class="img-responsive">
<p class="Common">The Gateway of India is an arch-monument built in the early twentieth century in the city of Mumbai, in the Indian state of Maharashtra. It was erected to commemorate the landing in December 1911 at Apollo Bunder, Mumbai (then Bombay) of King-Emperor George V and Queen-Empress Mary, the first British monarch to visit India. At the time of the royal visit, the gateway was not yet built, and a cardboard structure greeted the monarch. The foundation stone was laid in March 1911 for a monument built in the Indo-Saracenic style, incorporating elements of 16th-century Gujarati architecture. The final design of the monument by architect George Wittet was sanctioned only in 1914, and construction was completed in 1924. The structure is a triumphal arch made of basalt, which is 26 metres (85 feet) high.</p>

<h1>Marine Drive</h1>
<img src="https://jamshedpurguru.in/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Mumbais-Marine-Drive.jpg"class="img-responsive">
<br>
<br>
<p class="Common">Marine Drive is a 3.6-kilometre-long Promenade along the Netaji Subhash Chandra Bose Road in Mumbai, India. Often, the names Marine Drive and Mareens(Aliya) are used interchangeably to refer to this 3.9km stretch. The road and promenade were constructed by late philanthropist Bhagojisheth Keer and Pallonji Mistry. It is a 'C'-shaped six-lane concrete road along the coast of a natural bay. At the northern end of Marine Drive is Girgaon Chowpatty and the adjacent road along links Nariman Point at southern tip to Babulnath and Malabar Hill at northern tip. Marine Drive is situated on reclaimed land facing west-south-west. Marine Drive is also known as the Queen's Necklace because, when viewed at night from an elevated point anywhere along the drive, the street lights resemble a string of pearls in a necklace.</p>

<p id="Review">Rick Riordan’s Percy Jackson series played a huge role in my love of Greek mythology – the modern take on heroes and myths make them easier for a young audience to understand, and there are plenty of Easter eggs for those who already know their myths. The Lightning Thief kicks off the series wonderfully, introducing a loveable cast of characters that will stay with you for a long time.

Percy is a hero who’s brave and loyal for all the right reasons – his love for his family, both blood and found, make him a genuine and lovable protagonist. He isn’t the kind of hero who is unwilling dragged through his own story; he becomes immersed in this world along with the reader, and he quickly comes to love his fantastical new life and the people that come with it. The supporting cast is just as strong and substantial: Annabeth is never reduced to a damsel-in-distress, and she’s admired for her intelligence and strength rather than looks.
The quests the heroes must embark on throughout the series are direct parallels to Ancient Greek myths, but they feel fresh and new from the eyes of these young modern heroes. From the first novel, the plot is engaging and exciting, appealing to anyone who’s ever felt like they didn’t belong. Between all of the action, magic and riddles, it’s a truly heart-warming story about finding friends who eventually become family, and houses that eventually become homes.</p>

<p id="Review">Jason has a problem. He doesn’t remember anything before waking up on a school bus holding hands with a girl. Apparently she’s his girlfriend Piper, his best friend is a kid named Leo, and they’re all students in the Wilderness School, a boarding school for “bad kids.” What he did to end up here, Jason has no idea—except that everything seems very wrong.

Piper has a secret. Her father has been missing for three days, and her vivid nightmares reveal that he’s in terrible danger. Now her boyfriend doesn’t recognize her, and when a freak storm and strange creatures attack during a school field trip, she, Jason, and Leo are whisked away to someplace called Camp Half-Blood. What is going on?

Leo has a way with tools. His new cabin at Camp Half-Blood is filled with them. Seriously, the place beats Wilderness School hands down, with its weapons training, monsters, and fine-looking girls. What’s troubling is the curse everyone keeps talking about, and that a camper’s gone missing. Weirdest of all, his bunkmates insist they are all—including Leo—related to a god.</p>
